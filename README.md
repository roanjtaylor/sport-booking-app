# SportBooking

Sports facility booking platform with innovative team matchmaking.

## What it is

SportBooking improves how players book sports facilities by solving the "partial team" problem. Traditional booking systems force you to reserve full bookings regardless of group size, paying full price for unused spots. This lobby system allows individuals and small groups to join forces, enabling more affordable and flexible access to sports venues.
